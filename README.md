# Welcome to the NYC Potholes repo!

## About
This project is inspired a prompt provided at a session from NYC's Open Data Week 2021, called "Civic Hacking for Transit Equity," led by [co:census](https://cocensus.io). Though this prompt was not selected as a challenge during the session, the conversation during the session invigorated me to approach the challenge myself, which sought solutions for understanding inequities at the roadbed level. 


This repo has one module, Potholes.py, which contains a script for generating a choropleth map of average time to repair potholes across NYC.
